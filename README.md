# HK-CLPT: Hong Kong Cantonese Language Proficiency Test

The HK-CLPT is an unofficial framework (i.e. a system I made up) designed to evaluate Cantonese language proficiency. As a bilingual Cantonese speaker with literacy skills comparable to a kindergartener, I realized I needed a structured approach to guide me in learning to read and write Chinese characters. Unlike Mandarin (HSK) and Taiwanese (TOCFL), there is no standardized proficiency test for Cantonese. To fill this gap, I created the HK-CLPT with clear learning outcomes to serve as building blocks for improving my literacy. This framework uses traditional Chinese characters and emphasizes the colloquial Cantonese phrases unique to Hong Kong.

While the HK-CLPT is still conceptual, I plan to develop actual proficiency tests for each level in the future. This is a work in progress, but for now, this repository houses a curated collection of the Internet's best resources for learning Cantonese that Iâ€™ve discovered during my journey. Although originally designed to track my own progress, the HK-CLPT is a flexible framework that offers a structured path for anyone interested in learning Cantonese.

The resources in this repository provide a clear roadmap for progressing through the levels, from HK-CLPT 1 (Basic Survival Cantonese) to HK-CLPT 6 (Near-Native Proficiency). Eventually, I hope to introduce proficiency tests that will allow learners to demonstrate their mastery at each level.

## Proficiency Levels

The HK-CLPT framework consists of six levels, each progressively building vocabulary, characters, and conversational skills:

| **Level**       | **Focus**                                   | **Vocabulary** | **Characters** | **Learning Outcomes**                                                                                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HK-CLPT 1**   | Basic survival Cantonese                   | 150-300        | 100-150        | Understand and use basic phrases for everyday survival situations (e.g. shopping, greetings, ordering food). |
| **HK-CLPT 2**   | Simple conversations and practical tasks   | 300-600        | 150-300        | Communicate in simple conversations about familiar topics, including directions, transportation, and schedules.|

| **HK-CLPT 4**   | Complex topics and idiomatic expressions   | 1,200-2,400    | 600-1,000      | Discuss more complex topics (e.g. work, travel, health), understand idiomatic expressions, and give opinions. |
| **HK-CLPT 5**   | Advanced fluency and cultural nuances      | 2,400-3,500    | 1,000-1,500    | Understand advanced texts, express ideas fluently, and interpret cultural nuances in language and idioms.      |
| **HK-CLPT 6**   | Near-native proficiency                    | 3,500+         | 1,500-2,500    | Comprehend and produce near-native content, participate in debates, and appreciate Cantonese literature/media. |
