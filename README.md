# FAQ

## What is HK-CLPT?
The Hong Kong Cantonese Language Proficiency Test (HK-CLPT) is an unofficial framework designed to evaluate and support learners in mastering Hong Kong Cantonese. It emphasizes the use of traditional Chinese characters and focuses on practical, real-world language skills.

Currently, there is no internationally recognized proficiency test for Cantonese. While Hong Kong does have its own language proficiency tests, these are primarily intended for local use and are not widely accessible to international learners. HK-CLPT seeks to bridge this gap by offering:

* A structured framework inspired by the HSK (Mandarin proficiency test).
* Resources specifically tailored to Hong Kong Cantonese and its cultural context.
* Practice materials, mock tests, and (eventually) certifications for learners to measure their progress.

## What’s different about Hong Kong Cantonese?
Hong Kong Cantonese stands apart from other varieties, particularly the Cantonese spoken in mainland China, due to several key differences:

* Characters: Hong Kong primarily uses traditional Chinese characters, some of which are unique to the region and not commonly found in mainland China. This preserves a traditional writing system that reflects Hong Kong’s history and cultural identity.
* Vocabulary and Culture: The language is deeply connected to Hong Kong's unique cultural identity, incorporating words and expressions that reflect daily life, such as cha chaan teng (茶餐廳) (Hong Kong-style diners) and references to local infrastructure like the MTR (Mass Transit Railway).
* Grammar and Expressions: Colloquial Cantonese in Hong Kong is rich in sentence-final particles (e.g., 啦, 吖, 嘅) and distinctive phrases that convey tone, emotion, and subtlety. These features make Hong Kong Cantonese particularly expressive and nuanced.
  
HK-CLPT aims to help preserve and promote Hong Kong's rich cultural heritage through the Cantonese language, ensuring that its unique linguistic features continue to thrive in an increasingly globalized world.

## Who is this for?
HK-CLPT is designed for:

* International learners seeking to learn and measure their Cantonese proficiency.
* Educators who need a structured framework for teaching Hong Kong Cantonese.
* Fluent speakers of Cantonese who want to develop or improve their reading and writing skills, especially in traditional Chinese characters.
* Anyone interested in mastering Cantonese with a focus on Hong Kong-specific language and culture.

## What can I expect from this project?

HK-CLPT is in its early stages, designed to fill the gap in resources for Hong Kong Cantonese learners. Its goals include:

* Study Materials: Comprehensive vocabulary lists, grammar explanations, and cultural insights tailored to Hong Kong Cantonese.
* Mock Tests: Practice exams to help learners assess and track their proficiency.
* Certifications: Future tools to validate fluency and progress for learners seeking formal recognition.
  
Although unofficial, HK-CLPT strives to become a much-needed resource for Cantonese learners worldwide, offering structured support for anyone eager to connect with the language and culture.

## I'm interested in helping out! How can I contribute?

This is a passion project created by one person (i.e. me). I will continue building it out as I go through my learning journey. If you're interested in contributing, whether it’s by improving the framework, adding resources, or helping with development, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. Contributions are always welcome as the project evolves!

## Why was HK-CLPT created?

I was born and raised in San Francisco, the child of Vietnamese refugees, who were part of the Cantonese-speaking Chinese community in Vietnam ([Hoa people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoa_people)). My parents fled a turbulent period in history, bringing their culture and language with them to America. Since they never learned English, Cantonese became the only language we shared. It was my first language and the foundation of our bond.

Growing up, I was enrolled in Chinese school to learn to read and write. But as a child, I hated it and lacked the patience or appreciation for it. I complained, resisted, and eventually quit. My parents, too busy with work to enforce it, allowed me to stop. At the time, I felt relieved, but as an adult, I’ve come to regret that decision. While I am fluent in spoken Cantonese, my literacy is painfully limited—comparable to that of a kindergartener.

As I’ve worked to address this gap in my education, I’ve discovered how difficult it is to find resources tailored to Hong Kong Cantonese, particularly for learners like me who are already fluent in speaking but lack formal literacy. Most existing tools for learning Cantonese focus on spoken language, assuming learners are starting from scratch. This leaves fluent speakers without effective resources to improve their reading and writing skills, especially when it comes to mastering traditional Chinese characters.

Unlike Mandarin, which has structured frameworks like the HSK, Cantonese has no globally recognized equivalent. While Hong Kong does have internal proficiency tests, they are largely inaccessible to the international community. This lack of resources inspired me to create the HK-CLPT.

This project is a deeply personal endeavor—a way to help myself become literate in Cantonese while also creating a resource for others facing similar challenges. It is not official, nor is it affiliated with any governing body. I am simply one person, passionate about learning and sharing what I create along the way. I hope this framework will not only help me but also benefit others striving to connect with the Cantonese language and Hong Kong culture.
