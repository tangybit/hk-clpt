# HK-CLPT 0: Starting Out

The US Foreign Service Institute (FSI) classifies Cantonese as a **"super hard" language** for native English speakers to learn. The challenge stems from its **tonal system**, **homophones**, and a **written system** that occasionally differs from its spoken counterpart. Among these challenges, **pronunciation** is often the biggest hurdle for absolute beginners.

If you’re new to learning Cantonese, it’s essential to familiarize yourself with a few key concepts of the language first. Review these resources for a preliminary overview:

If you have a baseline understanding of the difference between written and spoken Cantonese, how tones affect pronunciation, and how to use the Jyutping system to read and pronounce words and phrases, you already have a solid foundation to get started. There’s no need to memorize all the tones right away—that will come naturally with practice.

As a first step, focus on understanding how these components work together and where to find reliable resources to reference as you learn. With this groundwork, you're ready to begin your Cantonese learning journey!
